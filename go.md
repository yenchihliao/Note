# Note

Some note about programming after the tutorial of golang(https://gobyexample.com)

## Variadic function

Functions of indefinite arity(number of argument a function takes), usually achieve by "..."

## Closure

Functions that return anonymous functions, lambda in python for example.

## Go

### class

No 'class' design as C++ but can be simulate by 'struct' and 'method'. 'method' simply that the corresponding 'struct' as its input

### slice

Simillar to the 'list' in python. A flexible array that has dynamic length and can be accessed by similar indexing ways that specifies a range.

### pointers

When accessing a method m of some struct s, use 's.m' regardless of s is a pointer or not. The notion of '->' in c++ is not needed
